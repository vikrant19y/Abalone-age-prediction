# Abalone Age Prediction
Overview
This repository contains code for predicting the age of abalone using machine learning techniques. Abalone age prediction is crucial for understanding population dynamics, informing management decisions, and promoting conservation efforts.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains measurements of physical characteristics of abalones, such as shell dimensions, weight, and sex, along with their corresponding age determined by counting the number of rings on their shell. The dataset is available here (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4/data).

# Installation
Clone the repository:

# bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vikrant19y/abalone-age-prediction.git
cd abalone-age-prediction

# Usage
Preprocess the data: If needed, preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.

Train the model: Use the provided scripts to train machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or unseen samples.
